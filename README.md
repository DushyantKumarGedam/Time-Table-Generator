# Timetable Generator
I created a simple timetable generator for a college project to help teachers and students organize and view schedules effectively.

To use this project (Timetable Generator), you will need the following prerequisites:
- XAMPP/WAMPP: Local setup with Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
- Python: Basic language for algorithmic tasks.
- MySQL: Crucial relational database for data storage.
- HTML, CSS: Front-end tools for design and structure.
- Java, PHP: Back-end elements for server functions and database control.
  
Instructions:
- Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start the 'Apache' and 'MySQL' servers.
- Go to your browser and type 'localhost/' or '127.0.0.1/', then go to phpmyadmin.
- Make a new database called 'project' in phpmyadmin.
- Import the sql file (project.sql) found in the sql directory.
